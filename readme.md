# My first REST-api

This REST-api is created for being used together with React project.

## Introduction
Welcome to my REST-api! This documentation should help you familiarise yourself with the resources available and how to consume them with HTTP requests. Read through the getting started section before you dive in.

## Dependencies
* **Mongoose** and **Mongo** are used for storing data;
* **Jsonwebtoken** - JWT is used to securely transmitting information between client and server;
* **Cookie-parser** - Cookie-parser is used for storing the JWT information;
* Other.

## Getting started
Let's make our first API request to the REST-api!

Open up a terminal and use curl or httpie to make an API request for a resource. In the example below, we're trying to get the first planet, Tatooine:
